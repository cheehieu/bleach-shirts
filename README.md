## Overview
I have a unique/weird clothing style. For some time now, I've been custom designing my own t-shirts and embroidered polo shirts (mostly with obscure media references). However, I usually create the design and have a 3rd party entity such as Vistaprint do the manufacturing.

Bleaching shirts is a quick DIY way to create cool shirt designs without the use of heavy printing equipment. After seeing some awesome designs on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/T-shirt-Designs-with-Stencils-and-Bleach/) and [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bleachshirts/), I decided to give it a try.

## Hardware
* Plain cotton t-shirt
* Freezer paper
* Cutter (knife, laser, etc.)
* Iron
* 50/50 bleach/water solution
* Spray bottle
* Cardboard
* Gloves

## Software
Vector design and stencil creation with a laser vinyl cutter.
